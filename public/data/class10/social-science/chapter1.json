    "description": "Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), revered as the 'Father of the Nation' in India, pioneered the philosophy and method of Satyagraha—literally 'truth-force' or 'soul-force'—as a transformative approach to political struggle and social reform. Rooted in the principle of ahimsa (non-violence) and the moral power of truth, Satyagraha rejected aggression, coercion, and hatred, instead seeking to convert the oppressor through self-suffering and moral appeal. Gandhi first experimented with Satyagraha in South Africa (1906–1914) to protest discriminatory laws against the Indian community, using methods such as non-cooperation, civil disobedience, and mass petitions. Upon returning to India, he refined Satyagraha into a mass movement—mobilizing peasants, workers, and the middle class in campaigns like the Champaran Satyagraha (1917), Kheda Satyagraha (1918), and later the Salt March (1930)—always insisting on strict discipline, peaceful protest, and moral courage in the face of repression. In CBSE Class 10 History, particularly in the chapter 'Nationalism in India', Gandhi’s explanation of Satyagraha emphasizes that non-violence was not a passive state but an active, brave confrontation with injustice, grounded in truth, and requiring immense self-control. Satyagraha aimed to win the battle of hearts rather than merely achieve political ends; it was as much about transforming society and relationships as it was about gaining independence. Gandhi believed that oppressive systems could not survive without the cooperation of the oppressed—thus, non-violent non-cooperation would morally and structurally weaken the regime, while uniting people across caste, religion, and class. This philosophy, taught with concrete historical examples in the curriculum, bridges ethical ideals with practical strategies for collective action, demonstrating that political change can be rooted in deep moral conviction."

    "description": "Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), India’s first Prime Minister and a central leader in the freedom movement, vividly documented his encounters with India’s rural masses, especially during peasant gatherings, in his autobiographical and historical writings such as 'An Autobiography' and 'Glimpses of World History'. One notable account, often included in CBSE Class 10 History narratives, describes his visit to a vast peasant assembly during the national struggle—where tens of thousands of farmers, dressed in their simple homespun khadi, had gathered not out of fear or coercion, but out of a shared awakening to their rights and dignity. Nehru observed that these gatherings were both political and deeply human events, marked by discipline, patience, and quiet determination, reflecting the social transformation brought about by Gandhi’s leadership and the spread of nationalist consciousness. He recalled being moved by the sight of ordinary men and women—once bound by deference to landlords or colonial officials—now speaking openly about their grievances, land rights, and freedom, their faces lit with hope. Such moments, Nehru wrote, convinced him that the real strength of India’s struggle lay in the awakened peasantry, whose sheer numbers and moral force could shake the foundations of imperial power. In the CBSE Class 10 curriculum, this anecdote is used to illustrate the deep penetration of nationalist ideas into rural India, the role of mass mobilization in the independence movement, and the emotional connection between leaders and the people. Nehru’s account emphasizes that the freedom struggle was not solely fought in legislative chambers or by urban elites, but in the hearts and minds of millions of villagers who, through collective gatherings, gave the movement its true mass character."
