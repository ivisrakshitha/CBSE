I helped my grandfather in the fields, saw the farmers preparing for the harvest, and even rode a bullock cart for the first time.\n\nLife in the village is simple but full of warmth. I wish you were here with me to enjoy the cool breeze and the peaceful evenings under the stars. When we meet next week, I’ll show you the pictures I took.\n\nTake care and write back soon.\n\nYour loving friend,\nKiran"
